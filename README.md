# CNC
School project - CNC with RPi in Python

So this is my first bigger project. I tried to build a CNC milling machine for fun and ended up programming it in Python on my Raspberry Pi 2 as a school project.
Since i'm learning python with this project, my code isnt professional at all and i'm happy if it works.

It's basically 4 DC motors and a servo, 2 motors for y-axis, 1 for x-axis, 1 for milling and the servo to move the milling motor up and down.
It works by reading a svg-file and searching for line and arc elements. I prefered to create my example svg with Inkscape, because this one creates easy-to-read svg's i can use for my project.

Oh and some text in my code is german, cause i'm german and it's a school project ^^'

Will add more information later.
